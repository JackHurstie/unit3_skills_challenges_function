## 1. Describe the Problem

_Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have._

## 2. Design the Function Signature

_Include the name of the function, its parameters, return value, and side effects._

```python
# EXAMPLE

def extract_uppercase(mixed_words):
    """Extracts uppercase words from a string

    Parameters: (list all parameters and their types)
        mixed_words: a string containing words (e.g. "hello WORLD")

    Returns: (state the return value and its type)
        a list of strings, each one a word (e.g. ["WORLD"])

    Side effects: (state any side effects)
        This function doesn't print anything or have any other side-effects
    """
    pass # Test-driving means _not_ writing any code here yet.
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the function will take and return._

```python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a lower and an uppercase word
It returns a list with the uppercase word
"""
extract_uppercase("hello WORLD") => ["WORLD"]
